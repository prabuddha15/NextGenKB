/*

    The annotation we are going to create is one which will be used to log the
    amount of time it takes a method to execute.

    The @Target annotation tells us where our annotation will be applicable.
    Here we are using ElementType.Method, which means it will only work on methods.
    If we tried to use the annotation anywhere else, then our code would fail to
    compile. This behavior makes sense, as our annotation will be used for logging
    method execution time.

    And @Retention just states whether the annotation will be available to the JVM
    at runtime or not. By default it is not, so Spring AOP would not be able to
    see the annotation. This is why itâ€™s been reconfigured.
